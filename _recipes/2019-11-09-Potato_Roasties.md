Title: Potato Roasties
*Yield*: 4 dinner servings

__INGREDIENTS__

* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 8-10 red potatoes, peeled and cut into 2- 3-inch chunks
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 2-3 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 3-4 cloves garlic, chopped
* sea salt

__PREPARATION__

1. Preheat oven to 400ÂºF, rack in middle of oven.
2. Add the oil to a rimmed sheet pan (13-by-18-inches) and place it in the oven.
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and boil until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Drain the potatoes in a colander and sprinkle with the flour. Shake the colander to distribute the flour evenly.
5. Carefully remove the pan with the hot oil from the oven. Spread the potatoes out in a single layer in the hot pan. The potatoes should sizzle upon making contact with the hot oil. 
6. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast the potatoes for about 1 hour, until golden brown. 
7. Every 15 to 20 minutes, flip the potato pieces, ensuring that all sides brown evenly. 
8. About 45 minutes into cooking, sprinkle the potatoes with the rosemary and/or the garlic, if using. 
9. Transfer to a cooling rack and generously season with the salt and serve.
